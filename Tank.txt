[COLOR="#FF8C00"][B][5. Builds > a. Tanking > ii. Tank][/B][/COLOR]


I call this The Tank Build simply because this build is one of the most effective and widely used builds among raid-ready tanks ([I]wait for it... somebody will correct me[/I]). This build is the staple bread 'n butter of the Guardian tanking repertoire. At your disposal are a number of forced taunts, taunt skills, melee skills that not only generate large amounts of threat but also stun and can debuff the enemy mob so they do less damage. You will be able to absorb large amounts of spike damage and take solace in knowing that you are building towards the gold standard of raid-ready tanking.

The basic criteria for being a tank;
[LIST=1]
[*]Lots of Morale
[*]Finesse: 10K (approx 20-25%)
[*]Capped Mitigations: 60%
[/LIST]
Optional criteria include;
[LIST]
[*]Block 20-25%, Parry 20-25%, Evade 15-20%
[*]Physical Mitigation 23-24K
[*]Tactical Mitigation 16-20K
[*]Critical Defence >= 50%
[*]Incoming Healing >= 15%
[*]Partial Mitigations
[/LIST]
The optional criteria while valuable is just that, optional in this build though you really should try to achieve these stats as well since they will increase your survivability.

[COLOR="#00FF00"][B]:: GEAR AND STATS ::[/B][/COLOR]

My Legendary Item legacies are tailored to my tanking playstyle which is more of an avoidance / threat tank. Below are some alternate legacy choices;

[LIST]
[*]Tank Belt { from: 'Light Damage',  to: 'Catch a Breadth Cooldown' }
[*][I]Regarding Pledge Magnitude, I feel as though this is a bit of a troll legacy, I dunno...[/I]
[*]1H Weapon { from: 'Bleed Damage', to: 'Sweeping Cut damage or Whirling damage' }
[/LIST]
[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]Fresh to level cap you are likely to only have armour and jewellery farmed through instances with quite possibly little or no essences or even gold. Below are some good starter gear and stats for you to aim for as a taunt tank.[/COLOR]

[B]Tank Recruit:[/B]
[I]* You are new to level 100, a fresh recruit. You want to start tanking and the fastest way may well be a stop to the Skirmish Camp.[/I]

[INDENT]28,587 Morale

38,849 (%) Physical Mastery
22.3% Resistance
48.7% Critical Defence
12.5% Incoming Healing

24.5 / 8.2 / 15.0 % Parry
11.1 / 3.6 / 11.1 % Evade
20,580 (60/31.0%) Physical Mitigation
9,559 (44.5%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

Pretty nice stats for a Guardian looking to prove themselves.

[B]Tank Veteran:[/B]
[I]* First off congratulations on your promotion to Tank Veteran! Now that your gear is a little bit better let's see how your stats have improved.[/I]

[INDENT]31,422 Morale

10,777 (21.4)% Finesse
42,611 (%) Physical Mastery
24.4% Resistance
63.6% Critical Defence
12.5% Incoming Healing
25.9 / 12.5 / 17.5 % Block

15.7 / 5.5  / 15.0 % Evade
22,914 (60.0 / 32.9%) Physical Mitigation
9,662 (44.8%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

Overall a very nice improvement. In fact, as long as you don't have to worry about Tactical Damage then you should be safe to tackle some Tier 2 content. Your Morale may be a little bit low but your other stats will help to make you feel a bit more solid and survivable.

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]As an established level cap Guardian you have been around long enough to be able to barter for essence gear and accumulate a stash of essences and gold. Below are various barter gear and jewellery that anyone can get solo, accompanied by stats.[/COLOR]

[B]Raid-ready Tank:[/B]
[I]* I salute you brother! You can now call yourself a Raid-ready Tank. This build is capable of taking on any content in the game. Spoiler Alert: there are more crazy builds below![/I]

[INDENT]44,056 Morale

63.6% Critical Defence
21.4% Incoming Healing
25.4 / 12.5 / 17.5 % Block
25.6 / 9.7 / 15.0 % Parry
14.4 / 4.8  / 14.4 % Evade
23,717 (60/35.6%) Physical Mitigation
15,275 (57.6%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

This build uses all Helm Hammerhand jewellery and the Dol Amroth 4-slot essence armour. Since the only essences are in your armour that is 24 essences. Overall this is the cheapest raid-ready tanking build to make in the game. If you have this exact build and somebody says that you're not raid-ready then they're either elitist or don't know what they're talking about.

When battles come down to a hanging thread, this build can create stories of legend (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHM9CQKAn14), hey I *only* had 13 [I]The Black Blade[/I] debuffs on me! =P

[B]Crafted Essence Tank:[/B]

24,186 (60.0 / 36.0%) Physical Mitigation
15,943 (58.8%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

An all essence build; you lose a lot of Vitality, Might and other passive stats that were on your jewellery which causes many of your stats to drop. You have the choice to make up your lost stats with essences, or you can beef up other stats as you see fit. I chose to bump up my Morale at the cost of my Physical Mastery and Resistance. I feel as though overall these stats are still fairly solid. Depending on your playstyle you could juggle 7-12K worth of Morale essences for Physical Mastery essences, this would be your personal preference.

[B]Barter Essence Tank:[/B]
[URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdflux/GuardianGuide/master/images/Barter-Essence-Tank.jpg"]screenshot of build[/URL], Minas Tirith barter essence armour and jewellery

24,341 (60.0 / 36.1%) Physical Mitigation
15,434 (57.9%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

Hmmm... interesting, though not surprising. The Minas Tirith Barter Essence armour & jewellery is similar but sacrifices Morale for Physical Mastery. 7K Morale for 8K Physical Mastery. Here's the thing, the crafted essence items have 3 slots instead of 2 and more Morale as a passive. If I had the essences I'd probably choose the crafted essence items over the barter items. This then also sets you up nicely for the endgame 5-slot essence build essence-wise.

There you have it people, my vision of an endgame tanking Guardian ([I]remember to check out my damage threat tank[/I]). As with any endgame build there will be stats that people don't agree on, so I'll try to defend some of my selections. Also remember that there is still a much better gold essence cloak that I don't have in this build.

In this build;
[LIST]
[*]I bumped up my Finesse to 25.7% because I want all of my stuns and fellowship maneuvers to hit successfully every single time.
[*]I slotted Partial Mitigation relics in my LI's instead of Morale because I felt that I had enough and thought survivability at this point was more important.
[*]I bumped up my Evasion for two reason, 1) to take less damage and 2) because I'm using partial mitigation relics now.
[*]I bumped up my Critical Defence a lot. Yes I know you only need 50% to negate critical damage but as an endgame build I wanted to go a step further and negate a large chunk of the devastate damage as well.
[/LIST]

I did all of this while keeping the Morale inline with the Crafted and Barter Essence Tank builds. This is, in my personal opinion, The Endgame Tank.

Blue versus Yellow tank builds...

Blue has self heals from Blocks and takes less damage since a Blue Guardian gains +10% Armour as well as +10% Mitigations. Blue also has access to the coveted Juggernaut.

Yellow will initially take more damage than Blue but can reduce that damage for both themselves and the rest of the group through debuffs. Yellow also has the potential to generate more damage threat than Blue. Yellow will require more healing than Blue but has Bring on the Pain as a source of emergency healing. Yellow also has slows which can be very effective in some boss fights.

Both Blue and Yellow are viable tanking builds.
