By definition a Guardian is one whom protects or defends something.

Your play style and how well you understand the mechanics, mobs and bosses of each instance will largely dictate how you decide to tank.


[COLOR="#FF8C00"][B][5. Builds > a. Tanking > i. Tank][/B][/COLOR]


I call this The Tank Build simply because this build is one of the most effective and widely used builds among raid-ready tanks ([I]wait for it... somebody will correct me[/I]). This build is the staple bread 'n butter of the Guardian tanking repertoire. At your disposal are a number of forced taunts, taunt skills, melee skills that not only generate large amounts of threat but also stun, but also the ability to debuff the enemy mob so they do less damage. You will be able to absorb large amounts of spike damage and take solace in knowing that you are building towards the gold standard of raid-ready tanking.

There are two basic criteria for being a tank;
[LIST=1]
[*]Stack as much Morale as possible.
[*]Finesse: 10K (approx 20-25%)
[*]Capped Mitigations: 60%
[/LIST]
Optional criteria include;
[LIST]
[*]Block 20-25%, Parry 20-25%, Evade 15-20%
[*]Physical Mitigation 23-24K
[*]Tactical Mitigation 16-20K
[*]Critical Defence >= 50%
[*]Incoming Healing >= 15%
[*]Partial Mitigations
[/LIST]
The optional criteria while valuable is just that, optional in this build though you really should try to achieve these stats as well since they will increase your survivability.

You have many skills at your disposal to grab, generate and maintain aggro (threat). Every time you generate threat you will see a red swirly arrow icon over the enemy's head, the larger the icon the more threat you generated. While having Physical Mastery is helpful in generating additional threat, as long as you have enough Finesse ([I]which helps you to bypass an enemy's Block, Parry and Evade chances[/I]) then your attacks will successfully hit your targets and should still generate plenty of damage threat.

You probably won't be able to maintain aggro with your melee skills alone if your Physical Mastery is low against well-geared DPS classes. To counter this you will want to try to save your big AoE forced taunt, Challenge, until after the DPS classes have unleashed some of their big AoE attacks. Your priority is to protect the healer so if you need to use Challenge earlier than do so. Along with Challenge you also have Fray the Edge which is a ranged forced taunt and Engage which is a melee forced taunt.

Forced Taunts use a threat catch-up mechanic. This means every forced taunt will give you 100% aggro plus 20%; the longer the battle the larger that 20% will be and thus the more difficult it will be for people to pull those enemies off of you. Similarly, early on that 20% will be very small and easier for people to pull aggro off of you.

Bash and Shield-smash and excellent shield skills to use not only for damage and threat but also as a source of crowd-control. These stuns will also give you an opportunity to apply your Stagger debuff. When you combine your stuns, Stagger debuff and War-chant debuff you should notice that you are taking less damage.

Depending on which build and thus emergency skills you chose [I]Bring on the Pain[/I] and  [I]Juggernaut[/I] are both incredibly useful for helping you to stay alive. In Blue Juggernaut will proc many Block heals and help to heal you mostly or all full. While Bring on the Pain will heal you on any damage taken, through if you are fighting a target that hits really hard Juggernaut is the better choice as large spike damage will out-damage the heals from Pain. Bring on the Pain can also be used as a skill to help generate heal threat, though for a short duration.

Every Guardian eventually develops an attack rotation to tag enemies with when starting a battle.

[LIST=1]
[*]Sweeping > War-chant > Shield-swipe > Shield-taunt > Shield-smash
[*]Stagger > Whirling or Sting > Shield-swipe > Bash > Shield-smash
[*]repeat...
[/LIST]
If you're planning on rounding up mobs then you will be relying more on Sweeping, War-chant and Shield-taunt and you have everything grouped together.

Try to save Challenge until your 3rd or 4th rotation, but if you don't have aggro by your 2nd rotation you may be forced to use it.

When Challenge is on cooldown Fray the Edge and Engage are your friends since they also do forced taunts. Engage however requires you to be within melee range so you may have to Charge to reacquire aggro on the target.

If you are in Yellow and have marked and fully debuffed your target then you can spread that targets debuffs to the 5 closest targets surrounding your target by using Cataclysmic Shout. Redirect is an excellent way to mitigate damage along with generating a small amount of threat.

Yellow Tanks can slow bosses such as the troll boss Dagron in Sunken Labyrinth. Our slow is incredibly potent and will allow your party members to out-run Dagron's otherwise extremely fast Charge.

Sting is a great cheap and fast skill to use that has a chance to open up your Block and Parry responses.

When you are tanking you always want to try and make sure that your front is facing the mob so that you get the most Blocks, Parries and Evades. Otherwise you can only Evade and that will decrease your survivability.

Early on in the battle, after an AoE Shield-smash stun, try to get behind one of the stunned enemies and hit them with Stagger following by a quick War-chant and then a Sweeping Cut. This will apply debuffs to the enemies and as a result you will end up taking less damage. Stagger applies +15% attack duration and War-chant applies -5% outgoing damage. Radiate and Insult to Injury will allow your AoE damaging attacks to spread your debuffs throughout the mob and refresh them.

Speaking of Blocks, Parries, Evades and Stuns... don't use Juggernaut followed by an AoE stun such Shield-smash because you just removed all sources of incoming blocks for a few seconds. Without Blocks then Juggernaut cannot heal you.

[COLOR="#00FF00"][B]:: GEAR AND STATS ::[/B][/COLOR]

My Legendary Item legacies are tailored to my tanking playstyle which is more of an avoidance / threat tank. Below are some alternate legacy choices;

[LIST]
[*]Tank Belt { from: 'Light Damage',  to: 'Catch a Breadth Cooldown' }
[*][I]Regarding Pledge Magnitude, I feel as though this is a bit of a troll legacy, I dunno...[/I]
[*]1H Weapon { from: 'Bleed Damage', to: 'Sweeping Cut damage or Whirling damage' }
[/LIST]
[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]Fresh to level cap you are likely to only have armour and jewellery farmed through instances with quite possibly little or no essences or even gold. Below are some good starter gear and stats for you to aim for as a taunt tank.[/COLOR]

Pretty nice stats for a Guardian looking to prove themselves.

[B]Tank Veteran:[/B]
[I]* First off congratulations on your promotion to Tank Veteran! Now that your gear is a little bit better let's see how your stats have improved.[/I]

9,662 (44.8%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

Overall a very nice improvement. In fact, as long as you don't have to worry about Tactical Damage then you should be safe to tackle some Tier 2 content. Your Morale may be a little bit low but your other stats will help to make you feel a bit more solid and survivable.

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]As an established level cap Guardian you have been around long enough to be able to barter for essence gear and accumulate a stash of essences and gold. Below are various barter gear and jewellery that anyone can get solo, accompanied by stats.[/COLOR]

23,717 (60/35.6%) Physical Mitigation
15,275 (57.6%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

This build uses all Helm Hammerhand jewellery and the Dol Amroth 4-slot essence armour. Since the only essences are in your armour that is 24 essences. Overall this is the cheapest raid-ready tanking build to make in the game. If you have this exact build and somebody says that you're not raid-ready then they're either elitist or don't know what they're talking about.

When battles come down to a hanging thread, this build can create stories of legend (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHM9CQKAn14), hey I *only* had 13 [I]The Black Blade[/I] debuffs on me! =P

15,943 (58.8%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

An all essence build; you lose a lot of Vitality, Might and other passive stats that were on your jewellery which causes many of your stats to drop. You have the choice to make up your lost stats with essences, or you can beef up other stats as you see fit. I chose to bump up my Morale at the cost of my Physical Mastery and Resistance. I feel as though overall these stats are still fairly solid. Depending on your playstyle you could juggle 7-12K worth of Morale essences for Physical Mastery essences, this would be your personal preference.

[B]Barter Essence Tank:[/B]

Hmmm... interesting, though not surprising. The Minas Tirith Barter Essence armour & jewellery is similar but sacrifices Morale for Physical Mastery. 7K Morale for 8K Physical Mastery. Here's the thing, the crafted essence items have 3 slots instead of 2 and more Morale as a passive. If I had the essences I'd probably choose the crafted essence items over the barter items. This then also sets you up nicely for the endgame 5-slot essence build essence-wise.

There you have it people, my vision of an endgame tanking Guardian ([I]remember to check out my damage threat tank[/I]). As with any endgame build there will be stats that people don't agree on, so I'll try to defend some of my selections. Also remember that there is still a much better gold essence cloak that I don't have in this build.

In this build;
[LIST]
[*]I bumped up my Finesse to 25.7% because I want all of my stuns and fellowship maneuvers to hit successfully every single time.
[*]I slotted Partial Mitigation relics in my LI's instead of Morale because I felt that I had enough and thought survivability at this point was more important.
[*]I bumped up my Evasion for two reason, 1) to take less damage and 2) because I'm using partial mitigation relics now.
[*]I bumped up my Critical Defence a lot. Yes I know you only need 50% to negate critical damage but as an endgame build I wanted to go a step further and negate a large chunk of the devastate damage as well.
[/LIST]

I did all of this while keeping the Morale inline with the Crafted and Barter Essence Tank builds. This is, in my personal opinion, The Endgame Tank.

Blue versus Yellow tank builds...

Blue has self heals from Blocks and takes less damage since a Blue Guardian gains +10% Armour as well as +10% Mitigations. Blue also has access to the coveted Juggernaut.

Yellow will initially take more damage than Blue but can reduce that damage for both themselves and the rest of the group through debuffs. Yellow also has the potential to generate more damage threat than Blue. Yellow will require more healing than Blue but has Bring on the Pain as a source of emergency healing. Yellow also has slows which can be very effective in some boss fights.

Both Blue and Yellow are viable tanking builds.
