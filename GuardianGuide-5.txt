While our primary role may be that of a tank Guardians also can excel in sustained AoE DPS, though suffering in the single-target department ([I]when there is only one target to attack[/I]). Unlike other DPS classes Guardians do not have consumables such as devastate pots nor do we have class trait skills to invest in that increase our devastate magnitude. That said, one of the things that sets Guardians apart from other DPS classes is our survivability and ability to self-heal while functioning as a DPS role.

For Guardians with low Physical Mastery, probably below 30-40K (?), the bulk of our DPS will come from two skills, [I]Prey on the Weak[/I] and [I]Guardian's Bleed - 10[/I].

For Guardians with mid-high Physical Mastery this changes as our bleeds and skills scale with our mastery rating, often causing your tier 10 guardian bleeds to be by far your top damage dealer followed by Sweeping Cut and Whirling Retaliation. http://oi62.tinypic.com/2epj33l.jpg

Will insert a MUCH LARGER description later this week as soon as I get a chance to...

[COLOR="#00FF00"][B]:: GEAR AND STATS ::[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]Fresh to level cap you are likely to only have gear and jewellery farmed through instances with quite possibly little or no essences or even gold. Below are some good starter gear and stats for you to aim for as a taunt tank.[/COLOR]

[B]As a greenie level cap this build boasts:[/B]
http://oi62.tinypic.com/35idukw.jpg
[I]* Two alternatives to the Ring of Berabhir could be the Greater Valourous Ring of Penetration (from Glinghant challenge and Warg Pengs T2C) or the Band of Fury from PvMP if you have Rank 6.[/I]
[INDENT]30,298 Morale
22.4 / 9.4 / 31.6% Critical Rating
27.4% Finesse
49,937 (129.9%) Physical Mastery
23.1% Resistance
30.5% Critical Defence
5.0% Incoming Healing
26.1 / 11.6 / 17.5 % Parry
8.7 / 2.8  / 8.7 % Evade
17,743 (60/38.0%) Physical Mitigation
9,815 (45.2%) Tactical Mitigation ([I]a bit low but not bad considering[/I])[/INDENT]

Similar stats to the greenie avoidance taunt tank build. A touch more key offensive stats in trade for a small amount of Morale and Critical Defense.

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]As an established level cap Guardian you have been around long enough to be able to barter for essence gear and accumulate a stash of essences and gold. Below are various barter gear and jewellery that anyone can get solo, accompanied by stats.[/COLOR]

Below I am going to show a few different possible setups based on areas that you may choose to farm for either reward tokens or stars of merit.

[B]Dol Amroth 4-slot essence gear with non-essence jewellery:[/B]
http://oi58.tinypic.com/2806z52.jpg
[INDENT]32,730 Morale
23.9 / 10.0 / 34.1% Critical Rating
22.9% Finesse
60,967 (160.4%) Physical Mastery
19.9% Resistance
31.0% Critical Defence
5.0% Incoming Healing
25.6 / 10.9 / 17.5 % Parry
8.0 / 2.5  / 8.0 % Evade
14,923 (56.9 / 26.8%)
13,504 (54.1%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

Not bad, but I feel as though this build could benefit with more essences. It's good but it has gaps.

[B]All craftable An√≥rien essence gear and jewellery:[/B]
http://oi61.tinypic.com/2s6n59s.jpg
[INDENT]31,852 Morale
24.9 / 10.0 / 35.8% Critical Rating
24.9% Finesse
61,709 (162.3%) Physical Mastery
14.4% Resistance
45.5% Critical Defence
5.0% Incoming Healing
23.8 / 8.7 / 17.5 % Parry
8.0 / 2.5  / 8.0 % Evade
15,349 (57.7 / 27.2%)
14,180 (55.5%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

This build is so heavy on essences ([I]expensive[/I]) and the issue with this craftable armour is that it has Fate instead of Might making it better suited towards a tanking setup. Also make note that if you skip BB-Hammerhand jewellery altogether than you lose out on the +10% Bleed Damage set bonus.

[B]Mix of Big Battle jewellery and Minas Tirith barter gear/jewellery:[/B]
http://oi58.tinypic.com/2dwafc5.jpg
[INDENT]31,075 Morale
25.0 / 10.0 / 36.5% Critical Rating
26.8% Finesse
61,104 (160.7%) Physical Mastery
17.8% Resistance
51.6% Critical Defence
5.0% Incoming Healing
25.4 / 10.7 / 17.5 % Parry
8.0 / 2.5  / 8.0 % Evade
15,490 (58.0 / 27.3%)
13,651 (54.4%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

Fairly solid. Adding some of the Big Battle jewellery back into the mix helped compared to all craftable gear and jewellery. Considering that I would not consider this to be an endgame build it is pretty decent.

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]Endgame Balanced DPS Guardian.[/COLOR]

http://oi58.tinypic.com/21awf47.jpg
[INDENT]27,471 Morale
24.2 / 10.0 / 34.6% Critical Rating
21.4% Finesse
70,000 (184.3%) Physical Mastery
17.7% Resistance
44.3% Critical Defence
5.0% Incoming Healing
24.7 / 9.8 / 17.5 % Parry
8.0 / 2.5  / 8.0 % Evade
15,695 (58.3 / 28.7%)
16,372 (59.5%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

70K Mastery in a Balanced DPS build that is still survivable like a tank, and if a person wants they can trade some Mastery for Morale.

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]Endgame Glass Cannon DPS Guardian.[/COLOR]

Well, I tried various setups for an endgame Glass Cannon build with 80K Mastery but nothing ended up being worth the trade-off for that extra 10K Mastery when compared to my endgame Balanced DPS build. I even tried way over-capping my Critical Rating and adding Critical Rating legacies and I found the gains to be minimal. So much so that I'm actually choosing to omit an endgame glass cannon build from my guide.
