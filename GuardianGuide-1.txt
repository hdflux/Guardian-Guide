Welcome to my Guardian Guide! While primarily written for level capped Guardians there are still strategical components and class trait builds that will still be useful as you level; for levelling and everything else Guardian related I recommend reading [URL="
https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?557663-Arathaert-s-Guardian-Guide"]Arathaert's[/URL] and [URL="
https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?557822-Dadi-s-Guide-to-Blue-Line-Tanking-(post-U14)
"]Dadi's[/URL] Guardian guides.

My goal with this guide was first and foremost to create a guide where everything listed in the guide is attainable without being forced to group ([I]it's an MMO so group if you can, but like me you may have your reasons to mostly solo[/I]).

Second is to inspire and motivate people to feel limitless in their possibilities. I want you to feel that epicness is within your reach, and I want you to achieve feats of greatness after learning from my guide.

Third is the final component of my guide which goes beyond what is achievable solo, your true endgame fellowship/raiding Guardian, a level of epicness where legends are not just born, they are made.

I have divided the guide into the first several posts in this thread.

Without further ado, enjoy reading my guide!

[COLOR="#FF8C00"][SIZE=4][B][-= 2. Essence Tips =-][/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]


As someone who has wasted countless scroll of essence reclamation the biggest advice that I can give you is to group essences of the same type together on a single gear or jewellery piece.

If you have say tanking and DPS builds then by having two gloves, one with all Morale and the other with all Physical Mastery, you can easily swap your gloves out depending on your build.

By having your essences grouped together it also allows you to park or finalize that essence piece so that you never have to touch it again. There will still be some straggler essences such as Tactical Mitigation, Finesse and Critical Rating that you can then group together on a single essence piece.

This strategy has worked out the best for me when it comes to planning out my essence gear and jewellery as well as the ease of making modifications to my essence configuration.

[COLOR="#FF8C00"][SIZE=4][B][-= 4. Builds =-][/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]

Everything you need to know about each build including target stats, gear, jewellery, legendary items and class trait tree builds.

You can also ask the [U]Trinity Tri-force Oracle[/U] to help decide for you what build, gear and stats to choose, which will also take into account your playstyle and current stats.

Ultimately treat the following builds as guides for you to reference and create your own hybrid build personally catered to your own Guardian.

When I post stats take note that because Zon is my baby that I have capped stat tomes and virtues invested, otherwise everything that I list below in the following builds are  obtainable through easy instance farming ([I]such as Great Barrows and Annuminas[/I]), crafting or from epic quest rewards.


[COLOR="#FF8C00"][SIZE=3][B][4. Builds > a. Tanking][/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]

By definition a Guardian is one whom protects or defends something.

Your play style and how well you understand the mechanics, mobs and bosses of each instance will largely dictate how you decide to tank.


[COLOR="#FF8C00"][B][4. Builds > a. Tanking > i. Taunt Tank][/B][/COLOR]

The Taunt Tank is the staple bread 'n butter of the Guardian tanking repetoire. Not only is it the easiest tanking build to play and therefore a great tanking build to start learning with, but it is also very effective at establishing aggro through taunts and absorbing huge amounts of spike damage. This is the gold standard tanking build for raids. As a taunt tank you may require full-time healing, your damage contribution to the fellowship will be non-existant, and Morale essences can be very expensive to accumulate.

There are two basic criteria for being a taunt tank;
[LIST=1]
[*]Stack as much Morale as possible.
[*]Establish and Hold aggro (threat).
[/LIST]
Optional criteria include;
[LIST]
[*]Block 20-25%, Parry 20-25%, Evade 10-20%
[*]Physical Mitigation 20-23K
[*]Tactical Mitigation 16K
[*]Critical Defence 50%
[*]Incoming Healing >15%
[/LIST]
The optional criteria while valuable is just that, optional in this build though you really should try to achieve these stats as well since they will increase your survivability.

As a taunt tank you are likely to have low Physical Mastery, Finesse and Critical Rating, it is for these reasons exactly why you are called a taunt tank. Focus on what you do best and build your Guardian tank around that. The early to mid part of every battle will be your most difficult to establish and maintain aggro. If you round up too many enemies then your Challenge may not force taunt all of them.

Likewise you are likely to lose aggro one or more times until later on in the battle due to the threat catch-up mechanic of your forced taunts. Every forced taunt will give you 100% aggro plus 20%; so the longer the battle the larger that 20% will be and thus the more difficult it will be for people to pull those enemies off of you. Similarly, early on that 20% will be very small and easier for people to pull aggro off of you.

As a taunt tank if you chose to trait [I]Bring on the Pain[/I] instead of [I]Juggernaught[/I] then a useful technique for establishing aggro in the beginning of a battle is to start off with Pain which will heal you for 2.5% Morale for any damage taken. This heal threat combined with any damage and taunt threat that you are generating should be enough to draw the ire of your enemies.

[COLOR="#00FF00"][B]:: GEAR AND STATS ::[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]Fresh to level cap you are likely to only have gear and jewellery farmed through instances with quite possibly little or no essences or even gold. Below are some good starter gear and stats for you to aim for as a taunt tank.[/COLOR]

http://oi62.tinypic.com/24uz2gm.jpg

As a greenie level cap this build boasts;

[INDENT]32,754 Morale
20.6% Critical Rating
16.7% Finesse
46,436 (115.4%) Physical Mastery
24.1% Resistance
65% Critical Defence
17.5% Incoming Healing
25.6% Block
25.6% Parry
14.7% Evade
26,438 (60/44.7%) Physical Mitigation ([I]enough to even cover hidden T2 mitigation[/I])
11,422 (49.4%) Tactical Mitigation ([I]a bit low but not bad considering[/I])[/INDENT]

Pretty nice stats for a Guardian looking to prove themselves.

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]As an established level cap Guardian you have been around long enough to be able to barter for essence gear and accumulate a stash of essences and gold. Below are various barter gear and jewellery that anyone can get solo, accompanied by stats.[/COLOR]

[COLOR="#00FF00"][B]:: CLASS TRAIT TREES ::[/B][/COLOR]

[URL="http://www.lotrottp.lotrostatus.com/l.php?c=3xF"]Blue Taunt Tank #1[/URL]
This build utilizes Pledge, Juggernaught, Block %, Parry %, Turn the Tables cooldown and Fray the Edge range.

[URL="http://www.lotrottp.lotrostatus.com/l.php?c=39v"]Blue Taunt Tank #2[/URL]
Similar to the first Blue Taunt Tank except we are trading Juggernaught for War-chant targets and Bring on the Pain. This build should be the superior of the two Blue Taunt Tank builds unless you absolutely need Juggernaught.

[URL="http://www.lotrottp.lotrostatus.com/l.php?c=3xD"]Yellow Tank[/URL]
This build utilizes Pledge and most of the Yellow tree.

Blue versus Yellow tank builds...

Blue has self heals from Blocks and takes less damage since a Blue Guardian gains +10% Armour as well as +10% Mitigations. Blue also has has access to the coveted Juggernaught.

Yellow will initially take more damage than Blue but can reduce that damage for both themselves and the rest of the group through debuffs. Yellow also has the potential to generate more damage threat than Blue. Yellow will require more healing than Blue but has Bring on the Pain as a source of emergency healing. Yellow also has slows which can be very effective in some boss fights.

Both Blue and Yellow are viable tanking builds.


[COLOR="#FF8C00"][B][4. Builds > a. Tanking > i. Avoidance Tank][/B][/COLOR]

The Avoidance Tank can be a fun tanking style to play. This was actually my original preferred tanking method and I first started playing this way at level 65 cap after being inspired by Warden tanking. Back in the day ([I]yes, I'm old enough to have earned the right to say that expression[/I]) before things such as Block heals, Bleed heals and Pain heals existed I relied on gear that proc'd a very small amount of morale and some that mitigated damage on any damage taken.

I wanted to create a tank that required little healing and thus meant less stress for the healer or allowed the Guardian to tank without a healer, say from even a Loremaster ([I]odd yes, but I've done it[/I]).

Can you tank difficult content with this build even though the Morale is only mid thirties? I have tanked Sunken Labrynth T2C, Ruined City T2C and Dome of Stars T2C.. each instance with 34-36K Morale. In DoS T2C I was able to complete the final fight with 10,312 max Morale largely due to some great healing but also because of my avoidances and partial mitigations.

When battles come down to a hanging thread, this build can create stories of legend (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHM9CQKAn14), hey I *only* had 13 [I]The Black Blade[/I] debuffs on me! =P

There are four factors that make a successful avoidance build; Block/Parry/Evade, Mitigations, Partial Mitigations and Critical Defence.

Required criteria for avoidance tank;
[LIST=1]
[*]At least 33K Morale.
[*]Block 25%, Parry 25%, Evade 15-20%
[*]Physical Mitigation 20-23K
[*]Tactical Mitigation 16K
[*]Critical Defence 50%
[/LIST]
Optional criteria;
[LIST]
[*]Incoming Healing >15%
[/LIST]
Legendary Item relics can be slotted to increase your partial block mitigation by 40% and your partial parry/evade mitigations by 20%. On a BPE that fails a dice roll for a full avoid you still have a chance to partially mitigate the damage, this is called a partial avoid with damage mitigated before it gets further mitigated by your physical/tactical mitigation. When I get a partial avoid a block will reduce the damage by 55% and a parry/evade will reduce the damage by 35%. When you apply partial mitigation with your critical defence and physical/tactical mitigation the incoming damage becomes more of a scratch or glancing blow.

Through your trait tree [Defensive Expertise] and [Skilled Deflection] you can increase your Block and Parry chance by five raw percentage points without diminishing returns. This can allow you to get 25% Block and Parry without having to invest heavily. Evade is a difficult stat to build up and may require a combination of Evasion on your jewellery / gear and even Evasion essences to build up to a respectable number between 15-20%.

For Critical Defence it is easy to get this above 50% with 3-4 essences or solely alone by using the Big Battle Helm Hammerhand tanking jewellery.

11,422 (49.4%) Tactical Mitigation ([I]a bit low but not bad considering[/I])[/INDENT]

Similar stats to the greenie taunt tank build because all of the gear is the same except now we have partial mitigation relics in our legendary items. This isn't the perfect avoidance tank build yet but it is already starting to look very promising!

Similar stats to the greenie avoidance taunt tank build. A touch more key offensive stats in trade for a small amount of Morale and Critical Defense.


[COLOR="#FF8C00"][SIZE=3][B][4. Builds > b. DPS][/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]

While our primary role may be that of a tank Guardians also can excel in sustained AoE DPS, though suffering in the single-target department ([I]when there is only one target to attack[/I]). Unlike other DPS classes Guardians do not have consumables such as devastate pots nor do we have class trait skills to invest in that increase our devastate magnitude. That said, one of the things that sets Guardians apart from other DPS classes is our survivability and ability to self-heal while functioning as a DPS role.

For Guardians with low Physical Mastery, probably below 30-40K (?), the bulk of our DPS will come from two skills, [I]Prey on the Weak[/I] and [I]Guardian's Bleed - 10[/I].

For Guardians with mid-high Physical Mastery this changes as our bleeds and skills scale with our mastery rating, often causing your tier 10 guardian bleeds to be by far your top damage dealer followed by Sweeping Cut and Whirling Retaliation. http://oi62.tinypic.com/2epj33l.jpg

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]As an established level cap Guardian you have been around long enough to be able to barter for essence gear and accumulate a stash of essences and gold. Below are various barter gear and jewellery that anyone can get solo, accompanied by stats.[/COLOR]

Below I am going to show a few different possible setups based on areas that you may choose to farm for either reward tokens or stars of merit.

[B]Dol Amroth 4-slot essence gear with non-essence jewellery:[/B]
http://oi58.tinypic.com/2806z52.jpg
[INDENT]32,730 Morale
23.9 / 10.0 / 34.1% Critical Rating
22.9% Finesse
60,967 (160.4%) Physical Mastery
19.9% Resistance
31.0% Critical Defence
5.0% Incoming Healing
25.6 / 10.9 / 17.5 % Parry
8.0 / 2.5  / 8.0 % Evade
14,923 (56.9 / 26.8%)
13,504 (54.1%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

Not bad, but I feel as though this build could benefit with more essences. It's good but it has gaps.

[B]All craftable AnÃ³rien essence gear and jewellery:[/B]
http://oi61.tinypic.com/2s6n59s.jpg
[INDENT]31,852 Morale
24.9 / 10.0 / 35.8% Critical Rating
24.9% Finesse
61,709 (162.3%) Physical Mastery
14.4% Resistance
45.5% Critical Defence
5.0% Incoming Healing
23.8 / 8.7 / 17.5 % Parry
8.0 / 2.5  / 8.0 % Evade
15,349 (57.7 / 27.2%)
14,180 (55.5%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

This build is so heavy on essences ([I]expensive[/I]) and the issue with this craftable armour is that it has Fate instead of Might making it better suited towards a tanking setup. Also make note that if you skip BB-Hammerhand jewellery altogether than you lose out on the +10% Bleed Damage set bonus.

[B]Mix of Big Battle jewellery and Minas Tirith barter gear/jewellery:[/B]
http://oi58.tinypic.com/2dwafc5.jpg
[INDENT]31,075 Morale
25.0 / 10.0 / 36.5% Critical Rating
26.8% Finesse
61,104 (160.7%) Physical Mastery
17.8% Resistance
51.6% Critical Defence
5.0% Incoming Healing
25.4 / 10.7 / 17.5 % Parry
8.0 / 2.5  / 8.0 % Evade
15,490 (58.0 / 27.3%)
13,651 (54.4%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

Fairly solid. Adding some of the Big Battle jewellery back into the mix helped compared to all craftable gear and jewellery. Considering that I would not consider this to be an endgame build it is pretty decent.

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]Endgame Balanced DPS Guardian.[/COLOR]

http://oi58.tinypic.com/21awf47.jpg
[INDENT]27,471 Morale
24.2 / 10.0 / 34.6% Critical Rating
21.4% Finesse
70,000 (184.3%) Physical Mastery
17.7% Resistance
44.3% Critical Defence
5.0% Incoming Healing
24.7 / 9.8 / 17.5 % Parry
8.0 / 2.5  / 8.0 % Evade
15,695 (58.3 / 28.7%)
16,372 (59.5%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

70K Mastery in a Balanced DPS build that is still survivable like a tank, and if a person wants they can trade some Mastery for Morale.

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]Endgame Glass Cannon DPS Guardian.[/COLOR]

Well, I tried various setups for an endgame Glass Cannon build with 80K Mastery but nothing ended up being worth the trade-off for that extra 10K Mastery when compared to my endgame Balanced DPS build. I even tried way over-capping my Critical Rating and adding Critcal Rating legacies and I found the gains to be minimal. So much so that I'm actually choosing to omit an endgame glass cannon build from my guide.
