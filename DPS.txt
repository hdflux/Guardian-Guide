While our primary role may be that of a tank Guardians also can excel in sustained AoE DPS, though suffering in the single-target department ([I]when there is only one target to attack[/I]). Unlike other DPS classes Guardians do not have consumables such as devastate pots nor do we have class trait skills to invest in that increase our devastate magnitude. That said, one of the things that sets Guardians apart from other DPS classes is our survivability and ability to self-heal while functioning as a DPS role.

For Guardians with low Physical Mastery, probably below 30-40K (?), the bulk of our DPS will come from two skills, [I]Prey on the Weak[/I] and [I]Guardian's Bleed - 10[/I].

For Guardians with mid-high Physical Mastery this changes as our bleeds and skills scale with our mastery rating, often causing your tier 10 guardian bleeds to be by far your top damage dealer followed by Sweeping Cut and Whirling Retaliation. http://oi62.tinypic.com/2epj33l.jpg

Will insert a MUCH LARGER description later this week as soon as I get a chance to...

[COLOR="#00FF00"][B]:: GEAR AND STATS ::[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]Fresh to level cap you are likely to only have armour and jewellery farmed through instances with quite possibly little or no essences or even gold. Below are some good starter gear and stats for you to aim for as a DPS Guardian.[/COLOR]

[B]DPS Recruit:[/B]
[I]* You are new to level 100, a fresh recruit. You want to start DPS'ing and the fastest way may well be a stop to the Skirmish Camp.[/I]

8,223 (40.4%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

Decent starting stats.

[B]DPS Veteran:[/B]
[I]* First off congratulations on your promotion to DPS Veteran! Now that your gear is a little bit better let's see how your stats have improved.[/I]

[INDENT]30,298 Morale

17,743 (60/38.0%) Physical Mitigation
9,815 (45.2%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

Not bad, but I feel as though this build could benefit with essence armour.

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]As an established level cap Guardian you have been around long enough to be able to barter for essence gear and accumulate a stash of essences and gold. Below are various barter gear and jewellery that anyone can get solo, accompanied by stats.[/COLOR]

[B]Raid-ready DPS:[/B]
[I]* I salute you brother! You can now consider yourself to be Raid-ready DPS.[/I]

14,923 (56.9 / 26.8%)
13,504 (54.1%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

A definite huge improvement from the DPS Veteran build! It's not perfect and there is room for improvement but very nice indeed. This build uses all Helm Hammerhand jewellery and the Dol Amroth 4-slot essence armour. Since the only essences are in your armour that is 24 essences. Overall this is the cheapest raid-ready DPS  build to make in the game. With proper skill rotations there is no reason why this build is not capable of parses between 12-25K DPS so there is no reason for people to say that you are not capable of DPS.

[B]Crafted Essence DPS:[/B]

8.0 / 2.5  / 8.0 % Evade
15,349 (57.7 / 27.2%)
14,180 (55.5%) Tactical Mitigation[/INDENT]

This build is very heavy on essencess ([I]expensive[/I]) and the issue with this craftable armour is that it has Fate instead of Might making it better suited towards a tanking setup. Also make note that if you skip BB-Hammerhand jewellery altogether than you lose out on the +10% Bleed Damage set bonus.

[B]Barter Essence DPS:[/B]

Fairly solid. Adding some of the Big Battle jewellery back into the mix helped compared to all craftable armour and jewellery. Considering that I would not consider this to be an endgame build it is pretty decent. Because the crafted essence gear is more suited towards tanking and since the stats are comparable I would probably opt for the barter essence gear. Maybe actually do barter essence armour and crafted essence jewellery.

70K Mastery in a Balanced DPS build that is still survivable like a tank, and if a person wants they can trade some Mastery for Morale.

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]Endgame Glass Cannon DPS Guardian.[/COLOR]

Well, I tried various setups for an endgame Glass Cannon build with 80K Mastery but nothing ended up being worth the trade-off for that extra 10K Mastery when compared to my endgame Balanced DPS build. I even tried way over-capping my Critical Rating and adding Critical Rating legacies and I found the gains to be minimal. So much so that I'm actually choosing to omit an endgame glass cannon build from my guide.
