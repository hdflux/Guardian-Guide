[COLOR="#FF8C00"][B][5. Builds > a. Tanking > i. Avoidance Tank][/B][/COLOR]

The Avoidance Tank can be a fun tanking style to play. This was actually my original preferred tanking method and I first started playing this way at level 65 cap after being inspired by Warden tanking. Back in the day ([I]yes, I'm old enough to have earned the right to say that expression[/I]) before things such as Block heals, Bleed heals and Pain heals existed I relied on gear that proc'd a very small amount of morale and some that mitigated damage on any damage taken.

I wanted to create a tank that required little healing and thus meant less stress for the healer or allowed the Guardian to tank without a healer, say from even a Loremaster ([I]odd yes, but I've done it[/I]).

Can you tank difficult content with this build even though the Morale is only mid thirties? I have tanked Sunken Labyrinth T2C, Ruined City T2C and Dome of Stars T2C.. each instance with 34-36K Morale. In DoS T2C I was able to complete the final fight with 10,312 max Morale largely due to some great healing but also because of my avoidances and partial mitigations.

That said I think it is very possible to create a very survivable avoidance tank that has Morale in the range of 40-50K.

When battles come down to a hanging thread, this build can create stories of legend (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHM9CQKAn14), hey I *only* had 13 [I]The Black Blade[/I] debuffs on me! =P

There are four factors that make a successful avoidance build; Block/Parry/Evade, Mitigations, Partial Mitigations and Critical Defence.

Required criteria for avoidance tank;
[LIST=1]
[*]At least 33K Morale.
[*]Block 25%, Parry 25%, Evade 15-20%
[*]Physical Mitigation 20-23K
[*]Tactical Mitigation 16K
[*]Critical Defence 50%
[/LIST]
Optional criteria;
[LIST]
[*]Incoming Healing >15%
[/LIST]
Legendary Item relics can be slotted to increase your partial block mitigation by 40% and your partial parry/evade mitigations by 20%. On a BPE that fails a dice roll for a full avoid you still have a chance to partially mitigate the damage, this is called a partial avoid with damage mitigated before it gets further mitigated by your physical/tactical mitigation. When I get a partial avoid a block will reduce the damage by 55% and a parry/evade will reduce the damage by 35%. When you apply partial mitigation with your critical defence and physical/tactical mitigation the incoming damage becomes more of a scratch or glancing blow.

Through your trait tree [Defensive Expertise] and [Skilled Deflection] you can increase your Block and Parry chance by five raw percentage points without diminishing returns. This can allow you to get 25% Block and Parry without having to invest heavily. Evade is a difficult stat to build up and may require a combination of Evasion on your jewellery / gear and even Evasion essences to build up to a respectable number between 15-20%.

For Critical Defence it is easy to get this above 50% with 3-4 essences or solely alone by using the Big Battle Helm Hammerhand tanking jewellery.

With avoidance tanks it is especially important to remember to have your front facing the enemy at all times unless you are kiting or gathering up mobs. This of course is important for all classes but to be the most effective at being an avoidance tank we need to get as many blocks, parries and evades as possible. The more BPE we get the more chance we also have to partially mitigate some of those attacks so that we take minimal damage.

We are most likely to have a higher Block and Parry chance than Evade simply because they are both easy and natural to build up. While I understand the importance of Block and Parry events as a longtime avoidance tank since 65 cap an Evade straight up means zero damage, and tactical damage can only be evaded, thus increasing the importance of Evade. That said, you are probably not likely to have over 20% Evasion as the cost investment would probably not be worth it.

Note that if you get stunned you cannot BPE, which is an avoidance tanks' worst nightmare. If however you can predict an incoming stun then pre-emptively cast Bring on the Pain so that you receive some heals while stunned.

Another priority is trying to keep the mob debuffed through slows, Stagger and War-chant. The less damage you take and less often means you survive longer.

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]Fresh to level cap you are likely to only have gear and jewellery farmed through instances with quite possibly little or no essences or even gold. Below are some good starter gear and stats for you to aim for as a taunt tank.[/COLOR]

[I]* Two alternatives to the Ring of Berabhir could be the Greater Valourous Ring of Penetration (from Glinghant challenge and Warg Pengs T2C) or the Band of Fury from PvMP if you have Rank 6.[/I]
[INDENT]31,302 Morale
20.6% Critical Rating
16.7% Finesse
46,996 (116.2%) Physical Mastery
24.1% Resistance

26.0 / 12.5 / 37.5 % Block
26.1 / 10.0 / 55.0 % Parry
16.0 / 5.7  / 35.0 % Evade
25,954 (60/43.3%) Physical Mitigation ([I]enough to even cover hidden T2 mitigation[/I])
11,422 (49.4%) Tactical Mitigation ([I]a bit low but not bad considering[/I])[/INDENT]

Similar stats to the greenie taunt tank build because all of the gear is the same except now we have partial mitigation relics in our legendary items. This isn't the perfect avoidance tank build yet but it is already starting to look very promising!

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]As an established level cap Guardian you have been around long enough to be able to barter for essence gear and accumulate a stash of essences and gold. Below are various barter gear and jewellery that anyone can get solo, accompanied by stats.[/COLOR]

This build is so heavy on essences ([I]expensive[/I]) and the issue with this craftable armour is that it has Fate instead of Might making it better suited towards a tanking setup. Also make note that if you skip BB-Hammerhand jewellery altogether than you lose out on the +10% Bleed Damage set bonus.
