[COLOR="#FF8C00"][B][5. Builds > a. Tanking > i. Avoidance Tank][/B][/COLOR]

The Avoidance Tank can be a fun tanking style to play. This was actually my original preferred tanking method and I first started playing this way at level 65 cap after being inspired by Warden tanking. Back in the day ([I]yes, I'm old enough to have earned the right to say that expression[/I]) before things such as Block heals, Bleed heals and Pain heals existed I relied on gear that proc'd a very small amount of morale and some that mitigated damage on any damage taken.

I wanted to create a tank that required little healing and thus meant less stress for the healer or allowed the Guardian to tank without a healer, say from even a Loremaster ([I]odd yes, but I've done it[/I]).

Can you tank difficult content with this build even though the Morale is only mid thirties? I have tanked Sunken Labrynth T2C, Ruined City T2C and Dome of Stars T2C.. each instance with 34-36K Morale. In DoS T2C I was able to complete the final fight with 10,312 max Morale largely due to some great healing but also because of my avoidances and partial mitigations.

When battles come down to a hanging thread, this build can create stories of legend (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHM9CQKAn14), hey I *only* had 13 [I]The Black Blade[/I] debuffs on me! =P

There are four factors that make a successful avoidance build; Block/Parry/Evade, Mitigations, Partial Mitigations and Critical Defence.

Required criteria for avoidance tank;
[LIST=1]
[*]At least 33K Morale.
[*]Block 25%, Parry 25%, Evade 15-20%
[*]Physical Mitigation 20-23K
[*]Tactical Mitigation 16K
[*]Critical Defence 50%
[/LIST]
Optional criteria;
[LIST]
[*]Incoming Healing >15%
[/LIST]
Legendary Item relics can be slotted to increase your partial block mitigation by 40% and your partial parry/evade mitigations by 20%. On a BPE that fails a dice roll for a full avoid you still have a chance to partially mitigate the damage, this is called a partial avoid with damage mitigated before it gets further mitigated by your physical/tactical mitigation. When I get a partial avoid a block will reduce the damage by 55% and a parry/evade will reduce the damage by 35%. When you apply partial mitigation with your critical defence and physical/tactical mitigation the incoming damage becomes more of a scratch or glancing blow.

Through your trait tree [Defensive Expertise] and [Skilled Deflection] you can increase your Block and Parry chance by five raw percentage points without diminishing returns. This can allow you to get 25% Block and Parry without having to invest heavily. Evade is a difficult stat to build up and may require a combination of Evasion on your jewellery / gear and even Evasion essences to build up to a respectable number between 15-20%.

For Critical Defence it is easy to get this above 50% with 3-4 essences or solely alone by using the Big Battle Helm Hammerhand tanking jewellery.

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]Fresh to level cap you are likely to only have gear and jewellery farmed through instances with quite possibly little or no essences or even gold. Below are some good starter gear and stats for you to aim for as a taunt tank.[/COLOR]

As a greenie level cap this build boasts;

[INDENT]31,302 Morale
20.6% Critical Rating
16.7% Finesse
46,996 (116.2%) Physical Mastery
24.1% Resistance
63.5% Critical Defence
17.5% Incoming Healing
26.0 / 12.5 / 37.5 % Block
26.1 / 10.0 / 55.0 % Parry
16.0 / 5.7  / 35.0 % Evade
25,954 (60/43.3%) Physical Mitigation ([I]enough to even cover hidden T2 mitigation[/I])
11,422 (49.4%) Tactical Mitigation ([I]a bit low but not bad considering[/I])[/INDENT]

Similar stats to the greenie taunt tank build because all of the gear is the same except now we have partial mitigation relics in our legendary items. This isn't the perfect avoidance tank build yet but it is already starting to look very promising!

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]As an established level cap Guardian you have been around long enough to be able to barter for essence gear and accumulate a stash of essences and gold. Below are various barter gear and jewellery that anyone can get solo, accompanied by stats.[/COLOR]
