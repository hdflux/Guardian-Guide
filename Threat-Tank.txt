Will insert a description as soon as I get time to this week.

[COLOR="#00FF00"][B]:: GEAR AND STATS ::[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]Fresh to level cap you are likely to only have gear and jewellery farmed through instances with quite possibly little or no essences or even gold. Below are some good starter gear and stats for you to aim for as a taunt tank.[/COLOR]

[B]As a greenie level cap this build boasts:[/B]

[I]* Two alternatives to the Ring of Berabhir could be the Greater Valourous Ring of Penetration (from Glinghant challenge and Warg Pengs T2C) or the Band of Fury from PvMP if you have Rank 6.[/I]
[INDENT]30,132 Morale
21.6 / 8.9 / 30.1% Critical Rating
27.4% Finesse
48,887 (118.6%) Physical Mastery
23.8% Resistance
55.7% Critical Defence
10.0% Incoming Healing
26.0 / 10.0 / 35.0 % Block
21.0 / 10.0 / 55.0 % Parry
12.3 / 4.0  / 32.3 % Evade
25,954 (60/43.3%) Physical Mitigation ([I]enough to even cover hidden T2 mitigation[/I])
11,422 (49.4%) Tactical Mitigation ([I]a bit low but not bad considering[/I])[/INDENT]

Similar stats to the greenie avoidance taunt tank build. A touch more key offensive stats in trade for a small amount of Morale and Critical Defense.

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]As an established level cap Guardian you have been around long enough to be able to barter for essence gear and accumulate a stash of essences and gold. Below are various barter gear and jewellery that anyone can get solo, accompanied by stats.[/COLOR]

This build is so heavy on essences ([I]expensive[/I]) and the issue with this craftable armour is that it has Fate instead of Might making it better suited towards a tanking setup. Also make note that if you skip BB-Hammerhand jewellery altogether than you lose out on the +10% Bleed Damage set bonus.
