[COLOR="#FF8C00"][B][5. Builds > a. Tanking > iii. Threat Tank][/B][/COLOR]

I wanted to create the Threat Tank with a similar kind of beefiness as The Tank build while being able to contribute a respectable amount of DPS for the group. The Threat Tank build may also be easier for Guardian's to build for if they already have a good DPS build without having to invest in a bunch of expensive Morale essences.

[COLOR="#00FF00"][B]:: GEAR AND STATS ::[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]Fresh to level cap you are likely to only have gear and jewellery farmed through instances with quite possibly little or no essences or even gold. Below are some good starter gear and stats for you to aim for as a taunt tank.[/COLOR]

[COLOR="#DDA0DD"]As an established level cap Guardian you have been around long enough to be able to barter for essence gear and accumulate a stash of essences and gold. Below are various barter gear and jewellery that anyone can get solo, accompanied by stats.[/COLOR]
