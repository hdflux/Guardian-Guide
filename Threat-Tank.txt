[COLOR="#FF8C00"][B][5. Builds > a. Tanking > iii. Threat Tank][/B][/COLOR]

I wanted to create the Threat Tank with a similar kind of beefiness as The Tank build while being able to contribute a respectable amount of DPS for the group. The Threat Tank build may also be easier for Guardian's to build for if they already have a good DPS build without having to invest in a bunch of expensive Morale essences. An endgame Guardian DPS will have around 60K or more Physical Mastery so this is mostly trading Physical Mastery for Morale so that you can still absorb damage.
