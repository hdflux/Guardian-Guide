Welcome to my Guardian Guide! While primarily written for level capped Guardians there are still strategical components and class trait builds that will still be useful as you level; for levelling and everything else Guardian related I recommend reading [URL="
https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?557663-Arathaert-s-Guardian-Guide"]Arathaert's[/URL] and [URL="
https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?557822-Dadi-s-Guide-to-Blue-Line-Tanking-(post-U14)
"]Dadi's[/URL] Guardian guides.

My goal with this guide was first and foremost to create a guide where everything listed in the guide is attainable without being forced to group ([I]it's an MMO so group if you can, but like me you may have your reasons to mostly solo[/I]).

Second is to inspire and motivate people to feel limitless in their possibilities. I want you to feel that epicness is within your reach, and I want you to achieve feats of greatness after learning from my guide.

Third is the final component of my guide which goes beyond what is achievable solo, your true endgame fellowship/raiding Guardian, a level of epicness where legends are not just born, they are made.

Without further ado, enjoy reading my guide!

[COLOR="#FF8C00"][SIZE=4][B][-= 1. Builds =-][/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]

Everything you need to know about each build including target stats, gear, jewellery, legendary items and class trait tree builds.

You can also ask the [U]Trinity Tri-force Oracle[/U] to help decide for you what build, gear and stats to choose, which will also take into account your playstyle and current stats.

Ultimately treat the following builds as guides for you to reference and create your own hybrid build personally catered to your own Guardian.


[COLOR="#FF8C00"][SIZE=3][B][1. Builds > a. Tanking][/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]

By definition a Guardian is one whom protects or defends something.

Your play style and how well you understand the mechanics, mobs and bosses of each instance will largely dictate how you decide to tank.


[COLOR="#FF8C00"][B][1. Builds > a. Tanking > i. Taunt Tank][/B][/COLOR]

The Taunt Tank is the staple bread 'n butter of the Guardian tanking repetoire. Not only is it the easiest tanking build to play and therefore a great tanking build to start learning with, but it is also very effective at establishing aggro through taunts and absorbing huge amounts of spike damage. This is the gold standard tanking build for raids. As a taunt tank you may require full-time healing, your damage contribution to the fellowship will be non-existant, and Morale essences can be very expensive to accumulate.

There are two basic criteria for being a taunt tank;
[LIST=1]
[*]Stack as much Morale as possible.
[*]Establish and Hold aggro (threat).
[/LIST]
Optional criteria include;
[LIST]
[*]Block 20-25%, Parry 20-25%, Evade 10-20%
[*]Physical Mitigation 20-23K
[*]Tactical Mitigation 16K
[*]Critical Defence 50%
[*]Incoming Healing >15%
[/LIST]
The optional criteria while valuable is just that, optional in this build though you really should try to achieve these stats as well since they will increase your survivability.

As a taunt tank you are likely to have low Physical Mastery, Finesse and Critical Rating, it is for these reasons exactly why you are called a taunt tank. Focus on what you do best and build your Guardian tank around that. The early to mid part of every battle will be your most difficult to establish and maintain aggro. If you round up too many enemies then your Challenge may not force taunt all of them.

Likewise you are likely to lose aggro one or more times until later on in the battle due to the threat catch-up mechanic of your forced taunts. Every forced taunt will give you 100% aggro plus 20%; so the longer the battle the larger that 20% will be and thus the more difficult it will be for people to pull those enemies off of you. Similarly, early on that 20% will be very small and easier for people to pull aggro off of you.

As a taunt tank if you chose to trait [I]Bring on the Pain[/I] instead of [I]Juggernaught[/I] then a useful technique for establishing aggro in the beginning of a battle is to start off with Pain which will heal you for 2.5% Morale for any damage taken. This heal threat combined with any damage and taunt threat that you are generating should be enough to draw the ire of your enemies.

[B]:: GEAR AND STATS ::[/B]

Fresh to level cap you are likely to only have gear and jewellery farmed through instances with quite possibly little or no essences or even gold. Below are some good starter gear and stats for you to aim for as a taunt tank.



As an established level cap Guardian you have been around long enough to be able to barter for essence gear and accumulate a stash of essences and gold. Below are various barter gear and jewellery that anyone can get solo, accompanied by stats.



The endgame taunt tank Guardian has access to everything and is assumed to have the resources to buy anything in the game. Below is some of the best gear in the game accompanied by stats.



[B]:: CLASS TRAIT TREES ::[/B]

[URL="http://www.lotrottp.lotrostatus.com/l.php?c=3xF"]Blue Taunt Tank[/URL]
This build utilizes Pledge, Juggernaught, Block %, Parry %, Turn the Tables cooldown and Fray the Edge range.

[URL="http://www.lotrottp.lotrostatus.com/l.php?c=3xD"]Yellow Tank[/URL]
This build utilizes Pledge and most of the Yellow tree.

Blue versus Yellow tank builds...

Blue has self heals from Blocks and takes less damage. Blue has has access to the coveted Juggernaught.

Yellow will initially take more damage than Blue but can reduce that damage for both themselves and the rest of the group through debuffs. Yellow also generates more damage threat. Yellow will require more healing than Blue but also has Bring on the Pain as a source of emergency healing. Yellow has slows which can be very effective in some boss fights.

Both Blue and Yellow are viable tanking builds.


[COLOR="#FF8C00"][B][1. Builds > a. Tanking > i. Avoidance Tank][/B][/COLOR]

The Avoidance Tank can be a fun tanking style to play. This was actually my original preferred tanking method and I first started playing this way at level 65 cap after being inspired by Warden tanking. I wanted to create a tank that required little healing and thus either created less stress for the healer or allowed the Guardian to tank without a healer or require very little healing, say from even a Loremaster ([I]odd yes, but I've done it[/I]).

There are four factors that make a successful avoidance build; Block/Parry/Evade, Mitigations, Partial Mitigations and Critical Defence.

Required criteria for avoidance tank;
[LIST=1]
[*]At least 33K Morale.
[*]Block 25%, Parry 25%, Evade 15-20%
[*]Physical Mitigation 20-23K
[*]Tactical Mitigation 16K
[*]Critical Defence 50%
[/LIST]
Optional criteria;
[LIST]
[*]Incoming Healing >15%
[/LIST]

Legendary Item relics can be slotted to increase your partial block mitigation by 40% and your partial parry/evade mitigations by 20%. On a BPE that fails a dice roll for a full avoid you still have a chance to partially mitigate the damage, this is called a partial avoid with damage mitigated before it gets further mitigated by your physical/tactical mitigation. When I get a partial avoid a block will reduce the damage by 55% and a parry/evade will reduce the damage by 35%. When you apply partial mitigation with your critical defence and physical/tactical mitigation the incoming damage becomes more of a scratch or glancing blow.

Through your trait tree [Defensive Expertise] and [Skilled Deflection] you can increase your Block and Parry chance by five raw percentage points without diminishing returns. This can allow you to get 25% Block and Parry without having to invest heavily. Evade is a difficult stat to build up and may require a combination of Evasion on your jewellery / gear and even Evasion essences to build up to a respectable number between 15-20%.

For Critical Defence it is easy to get this above 50% with 3-4 essences or solely alone by using the Big Battle Helm Hammerhand tanking jewellery.

First and foremost you must realize that we are not a huge crit/dev number class. We can achieve high AoE dps, but it is a sustained dps. When done correctly your tier 10 bleed damage will comprise the majority of your AoE damage. Having a high critical hit chance  (20-25%) and getting rank 3 in Radiate is key to your dps.

When I am either engaging a difficult mob ([I]such as a Tarlang’s Crown mob[/I]) or gathering up a large mob I choose to start off by wearing my tanking belt, shield and tanking sword. This gives me my block events ([I]very important[/I]), extra critical defence and partial mitigations via relics in my tanking legendary items. With my Charge stun prepped, once I have clumped the mob into a ball I let loose either a Sweeping Wing or Whirling Retaliation which will hit 10 targets stunning all of them. I immediately run through behind them, camera flip and use a Stagger to get a guaranteed crit from positional behind which applies the -15% attack duration debuff. I follow this with a War-Chant for -5% damage and then let loose my AoE attacks to spread debuffs to the entire mob. Usually 3-4 AoE attacks should be sufficient to not only debuff the entire mob but also tier up the bleeds to tier 10 on the entire mob as well.

Now that we have the entire mob debuffed and with tier 10 bleeds we are ready to switch to our dps belt and dps 2H. Even though we probably haven’t killed anything yet their outgoing dps combined with the heals you will be getting are not much to worry about. If you really need to you can pop Guardian’s Pledge and Warrior’s Heart, or even switch back to your shield for a while longer.

Since we have a high crit chance each of our big AoE attacks will be healing us for 10k to over 20k morale per swing. Yes, per swing... that is until their numbers start to dwindle a bit, even then this build can still hold up against a hard hitting single target. From my experience Sweeping Wind always yields the largest burst healing, followed by Whirling Retaliation. With an Incoming Healing rating of 15-25% you should be able to expect each heal to be in the range of 1500-2500 or higher. When you combine each [Thrill of Battle] crit heal from your AoE with your bleed refresh heals from [Radiate] suddenly all of those little heals in your single AoE attack combine to give you what appears to be a huge heal but is just a bunch of small heals.

For every time that we receive one of those huge burst heals we are also dishing out huge amounts of damage to the enemies since we are both crit’ing on them and refreshing our bleeds on them.

While attacking the enemy and waiting for your AoE cooldowns ([I]Sweeping, Whirling, Vexing[/I]) take the moment to get off either an Overwhelm bleed cashout or an Honourable Combat for a big heal followed by To the King to give yourself -20% attack duration and +10% damage, the difference is immediately noticeable. Try to keep the TtK buff active by using it every 10-15 seconds.

For single-target dps such as boss fights you may find yourself burning through Power too quickly wielding a 2H, or simply am taking too much damage and cannot heal yourself fast enough. Swap back to your shield. Try to keep Guardian’s Ward active and also try to keep the Stagger and War-chant debuffs active as well. When wearing a shield the most efficient attack rotation for heals will be
Shield-swipe > Retaliation > Thrust > Bash > To the King
Each of these will heal you as well as provide you with 2 possible free interrupts. Also, it may just be my imagination but I find it easier to crit on TtK after I have stunned the enemy with Bash. Do not hesitate on using a [Shield-blow] or [Force Opening] to open up your block and parry chains, the longer you wait the lower your morale may get. Hopefully Guardian’s Ward will provide enough parry/block chances to not rely too much on these two Power expensive skills.

If you find yourself in a predicament where you have rounded up too many enemies you can still survive by doing a technique that I call Circular Kiting. It involves kiting around the enemy in a large circle using your strafe keys so that you are always facing the enemy and also not reducing your movement speed by say moving backwards. You always want to keep a sizeable gap between yourself and the enemy mob, probably the length of about 3 Uruks. This length should be just barely around 5.2 metres in length which will allow you to attack the enemy mob with your AoE attacks, while also keeping in mind that War-Chant has a 10 metre range in case you need more practice Circular Kiting and prefer to keep your distance from the enemy mob; War-chant will still trigger Radiate which will in-turn give you some heals.

[SIZE=4][B]-= Getting Stunned while wielding a Two-hander =-[/B][/SIZE]

If you get stunned while wielding a 2H you may notice that you take a lot of damage. To help mitigate a portion of the damage you can quickly swap on your Shield 'n Sword. Once you break free from the stun you can swap back to your 2H and shing shing away.

[url]http://www.lotrottp.lotrostatus.com/l.php?c=2zt[/url]
* This build gives you [B][Guardian's Pledge][/B], [B][Bring on the Pain][/B], [B][Shield-smash][/B] and [War-chant Targets]. [U]I think this build may be the go-to build for Update 16[/U], where you might switch to the more standard tanking build with Juggernaught if you are tanking a hard-hitting boss.

[I][SIZE=3][B]Ettenmoors[/B][/SIZE][/I]

In my opinion the two strongest builds for a Guardian in the Ettenmoors is;

Primary Red but most points in Yellow and Blue;
[url]http://www.lotrottp.lotrostatus.com/l.php?c=2zs[/url]
[I]* This build provides the Guardian with both [B][Guardian's Pledge][/B] and [B][Bring on the Pain][/B] giving the Guardian nigh invincibility. It also has some optional single-target skills such as Thrust and Brutal Assault but unlike a deep Red build this build will lack some of the finishing killing power that it's counterpart has. In the case of this build it will be extremely difficult if not impossible to kill a Guardian using this build even if you are kiting them.[/I]

Deep Red with Pledge
[url]http://www.lotrottp.lotrostatus.com/l.php?c=2c4[/url]
[I]* This build is for Guardian's that want to focus more heavily on their damage and finishing combo potential ([I]such as Overwhelm > To the King > Hammer-down[/I]), maximizing their bleed damage and bleed cashout damage. The Guardian may also not necessarily want to rely on the handicap of Bring on the Pain, where Pledge will still offer an emergency skill if the Guardian gets ganked, but it's not EZ-Mode like the build I listed above that has both Pledge and Pain.[/I]

[SIZE=4][B]-= Virtues =-[/B][/SIZE]

The virtues that I run are;

Discipline - essentially a free greater essence of physical mastery with the bonus of resistance and physical mitigation
Fidelity - huge tactical mitigation with a little bit of vitality of morale
Honour - huge resistance with a good amount of tactical mitigation and vitality
Innocence - a nice trinity of phyiscal and tactical mitigation with resistance
Tolerence - huge tactical mitigation

Using these virtues I am able to use my essences on other stats.

[SIZE=4][B]-= Stats to Aim for as a Starting Goal =-[/B][/SIZE]

Morale: 25,000
Block: 25% ([I]around 15k [Deflected Blows][/I])
Parry: 25% ([I]around 13k with [Skilled Deflection][/I])
Evade: 5% ([I]not important for now, you can improve this later[/I])
Critical Hit Chance: 20% ([I]around 12k[/I])
Finesse: 20% ([I]around 12k[/I])
Critical Defence 45% ([I]around 9k[/I])
Incoming Healing: 15% ([I]around 4k[/I])
Resistance: 25% ([I]around 13k[/I])
Physical Mitigation: 55% ([I]14k[/I])
Tactical Mitigation: 45% ([I]maybe around 10k[/I])

[I]* The percent value can be found by hovering over the raw number in the tool-tip.[/I]

These stats will leave plenty of room for growth and in my opinion are attainable without having to rely on essences.

[SIZE=4][B]-= My Stats =-[/B][/SIZE]

In my builds there is still lots of room for improvement such as Supreme Essences and gold Hammerhand jewellery.
