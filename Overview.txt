Welcome to my Guardian Guide! While primarily written for level capped Guardians there are still strategical components and class trait builds that will still be useful as you level; for levelling and everything else Guardian related I recommend reading [URL="https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?557663-Arathaert-s-Guardian-Guide"]Arathaert's[/URL] and [URL="https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?557822-Dadi-s-Guide-to-Blue-Line-Tanking-(post-U14"]Dadi's[/URL] Guardian guides.

My goal with this guide was first and foremost to create a guide where everything listed in the guide is attainable without being forced to group ([I]it's an MMO so group if you can, but like me you may have your reasons to mostly solo[/I]).

Second is to inspire and motivate people to feel limitless in their possibilities. I want you to feel that epicness is within your reach, and I want you to achieve feats of greatness after learning from my guide.

Third is the final component of my guide which goes beyond what is achievable solo, your true endgame fellowship/raiding Guardian, a level of epicness where legends are not just born, they are made.

I have divided the guide into the first several posts in this thread.

Without further ado, enjoy reading my guide!

[COLOR="#FF8C00"][SIZE=4][B][-= 2. Essence Tips =-][/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]


As someone who has wasted countless scroll of essence reclamation the biggest advice that I can give you is to group essences of the same type together on a single gear or jewellery piece.

If you have say tanking and DPS builds then by having two gloves, one with all Morale and the other with all Physical Mastery, you can easily swap your gloves out depending on your build.

By having your essences grouped together it also allows you to park or finalize that essence piece so that you never have to touch it again. There will still be some straggler essences such as Tactical Mitigation, Finesse and Critical Rating that you can then group together on a single essence piece.

This strategy has worked out the best for me when it comes to planning out my essence gear and jewellery as well as the ease of making modifications to my essence configuration.

Everything you need to know about each build including target stats, gear, jewellery, legendary items and class trait tree builds.

You can also ask the [U]Trinity Tri-force Oracle[/U] to help decide for you what build, gear and stats to choose, which will also take into account your playstyle and current stats.

Ultimately treat the following builds as guides for you to reference and create your own hybrid build personally catered to your own Guardian.

All greenie build gear can be instance farmed from the following loot table. It's for Update 12 but just remember that this loot scales so it is good for level 100 as well.
https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?535472-Update-12-1-Scaling-Instance-Loot

It should be noted that the legacies in my legendary items shown in my screenshots are custom tailored towards my own personal play style which is that of avoidance tank, threat tank and dps. I will however add sections to each build describing what legacies, relics and imbued vs non-imbued I would personally use.
